                <h2>How to Make</h2>
                <p>
                    In a bowl, mix the flour with warm water, yeast, and salt. Mix enough warm water so that the dough is soft but not runny, approx. 2-3 cups, it may vary each time you make it. Should feel like bread dough, not pasta dough (soft not hard).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Knead the dough, coating it with flour as you need to to prevent from sticking. Knead until you are able to form into a smooth ball. Place the ball in a bowl, Put a drop of oil (any oil will due) on top of the ball and spread gently over the ball to cover the top. This prevents a crust forming on the top as it rises. Cover and let rest for approx. 2 hours, or until the dough has doubled in size.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Form dough into 8-10 smaller balls, about the size of a fist. Cover and let rest for approx. 20 minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mix all ingredients for the filling together in a bowl. Set aside.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For each dough ball, flatten dough into a long rectangle, keep dough approximately the thickness of a finger. Scoop the filling onto one side of the flattened dough (about 3 or 4 tablespoons). Fold the dough over the filling, push down and fold the edge of the dough in order to close in the filling. <em>“You gotta close em up very very good” - Nonna</em>

                    Lay the raw Calascioni on a pan(s) lined with parchment paper. Break an egg or two, and separate the yolk(s). Beat the yolk well, and brush the egg yolk over each of the raw Calascioni. Completely cover the top of each Calascioni. Once coated with egg yolk, poke the top of each Calascioni with a fork, creating a series of holes about an inch or two apart. 
                </p>

                    Bake at 350°F for 45 minutes.
